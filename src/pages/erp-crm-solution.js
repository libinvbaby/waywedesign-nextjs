                    ERP and CRM solutions can integrate with each other through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and middleware. By integrating ERP and CRM systems, businesses can gain a complete view of their operations and customers, which can lead to better decision-making and improved business outcomes. For example, a CRM system can pull data from an ERP system to provide sales teams with real-time inventory levels and delivery times, enabling them to provide more accurate quotes and delivery estimates to customers
